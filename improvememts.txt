🔥 Improvement 1 — Add Real-Time Streaming

Instead of uploading full file,
use streaming chunks via WebSocket.

🔥 Improvement 2 — Reduce 30s Recording

Your record duration is:

duration=30

This is too long.

For keyword spotting:

1–2 seconds max
🔥 Improvement 3 — Normalize Features

Before training:

X = (X - mean) / std

This will drastically improve accuracy.

🔥 Improvement 4 — Add Unknown Class

Right now everything becomes _background_noise_.

Better to:

classes = ['unknown', 'cat', 'dog', 'house']

And train properly.

🔥 Improvement 5 — Convert Model to TensorFlow Lite

If this is for mobile:

Convert .h5 → .tflite

Huge performance boost.

🏆 Final Verdict

Your architecture is actually GOOD.

You are missing only:

Dataset

Training step

Model file

That’s it.
